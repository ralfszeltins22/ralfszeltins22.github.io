This is the E-klase Dark theme made by ralfszeltins2

Use this with an extension like Stylus, add the code from style.css and you're done!

This is unfinished, so you may encounter some issues.

[IMPORTANT] Using the core.css version is NOT recommended! It is only meant to show temporarily before the full css loads.
Do NOT use the tampermonkey.css version! It will cause issues with the tampermonkey extension.
